# Biologically Inspired Perching Drone
This project is inspired by the claws of birds of prey and their unique biological ratcheting mechanism that allows them to tightly and securely grip with their talons without relying entirely on muscular strength.

The files within the project contain both the hardware and software required to build a claw attachment for a drone.
